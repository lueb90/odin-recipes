A webpage with a list of recipes i like and links to sad recipes on other pages.

To set this up I will need to create a file called index.html as a homepage containing my recipe list. This file needs a html boilerplate and proper structure. I than write some headings in the body and lists with recipes.

Then I make more html sites, one for each recipe. When i commit them, i can link from the homepage to the other recipes.

Profit.
